# 의존성 지옥

“Dependency Hell” is the colloquialism for a situation where the graph
of dependencies required by a project cannot be met. The end-user is 
then required to solve the scenario; usually a difficult task:

1. The conflict may be in unfamiliar dependencies (of dependencies) that the user did not explicitly request
2. Due to the nature of development it would be rare for two dependency graphs to be the same. Thus the amount of help other users (often even the package authors) can offer is limited. Internet searches will likely prove fruitless.

A good package manager should be designed from the start to minimize the risk
of dependency hell and where this is not possible, to mitigate it and provide
tooling so that the end-user can solve the scenario with a minimum of
trouble. The [Package Manager Community Proposal] contains our thoughts on
how we intend to iterate with these hells in mind.

The following are some of the most common “dependency hell” scenarios:

## 부적합한 버저닝
A package may specify an inappropriate version for a release.
  For example, a version is tagged `1.2.3`,
  but introduces extensive, breaking API changes
  that should be reflected by a major version bump to `2.0.0`.

## 호환되지 않는 메이저 버전 요구사항
A package may have dependencies
  with incompatible version requirements for the same package.
  For example, if `Foo` depends on `Baz` at version `~>1.0`
  and `Bar` depends on `Baz` at version `~>2.0`,
  then there is no one version of `Baz` that can satisfy both requirements.
  This situation often arises when a dependency shared by many packages
  updates to a new major version,
  and it takes a long time for all of those packages to update their dependency.

##호환되지 않는 마이너 또는 업데이트 버전 요구사항
A package may have dependencies that are specified too strictly,
  such that version requirements are incompatible for different minor or update versions.
  For example, if `Foo` depends on `Baz` at version `==2.0.1`
  and `Bar` depends on `Baz` at version `==2.0.2`,
  once again, there is no one version of `Baz` that can satisfy both requirements.
  This is often the result of a regression introduced in a patch release of a dependency,
  which causes a package to lock that dependency to a particular version.

## 네임 스페이스 충돌 
A package may have two or more dependencies that have the same name.
  For example, a `Person` package depends on
  an `Addressable` package that defines a protocol
  for assigning a mailing address to a person,
  as well as
  an `Addressable` package that defines a protocol
  for speaking formally to another person.

## 망가진 소프트웨어
A package may have a dependency with an outstanding bug
  that is impacting usability, security, or performance.
  This may simply be a matter of timeliness on the part of the package maintainers,
  or a disagreement about their expectations for the package.

## 글로벌 스테이트 충돌
A package may have two or more dependencies that
  presume to have exclusive access to the same global state.
  For example, one package may not be able to accommodate
  another package writing to a particular file path
  while reading from that same file path.

## 패키지가 사용불가인 상태가 되다 
A package may have a dependency on a package that becomes unavailable.
  This may be caused by the source URL becoming inaccessible,
  or maintainers deleting a published version.
